**Implementation Date:** 2025-09-23 23:11:10  
**Feature Branch:** `feature/29-enhanced-analyzer-output`  
**Pull Request:** [#30](https://github.com/mojisejr/pootdee/pull/30)  
**Related Issue:** [#29](https://github.com/mojisejr/pootdee/issues/29)

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the enhanced analyzer output system with comprehensive analysis capabilities. This represents Phase 2 completion of the multi-phase enhanced analyzer implementation plan.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ Core Interface Enhancements
- **Enhanced `EnhancedAnalyzerOutput` interface** with new properties:
  - `overallRating`: 1-5 star rating system for quick assessment
  - `severity`: Low/Medium/High severity classification  
  - `friendlyHeadings`: User-friendly section titles for better UX
  - Enhanced sub-analysis structures for grammar, vocabulary, and context

### ✅ Detailed Sub-Analysis Features
- **Grammar Analysis Enhancements**:
  - `structureComparison`: Compares sentence structures
  - `tenseAnalysis`: Detailed tense usage analysis
- **Vocabulary Analysis Enhancements**:
  - `wordAnalysis`: Individual word-level analysis
  - `phoneticBreakdown`: Pronunciation and phonetic guidance
- **Context Analysis Enhancements**:
  - `improvements`: Specific improvement suggestions
  - `formality`: Formality level assessment

### ✅ Technical Improvements
- Updated analyzer service to use `EnhancedAnalyzerOutput`
- Fixed type mismatches across workflow, analyzer, and phrase services
- Removed unused `AnalyzerOutput` references throughout codebase
- Added `EnhancedCreatePhraseInput` interface for enhanced phrase creation
- Updated Sanity schema to support enhanced analysis data
- Fixed all TypeScript errors and linter warnings
