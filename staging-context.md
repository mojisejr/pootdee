# Staging Context - LangGraph Workflow Testing Implementation

**Implementation Date**: 2025-09-22 07:44:28
**Issue**: #14 - Create unit and integration tests for LangGraph workflow
**Feature Branch**: feature/14-langraph-workflow-testing

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive unit and integration tests for the LangGraph workflow system with the following key achievements:

### 🧪 Testing Infrastructure
- **Migrated from Node.js test runner to Vitest** for better TypeScript support and ES module handling
- **Created Vitest configuration** with proper path aliases and test environment setup
- **Resolved module resolution issues** that were causing circular dependency errors

### 📋 Test Coverage Implemented

#### 1. API Layer Tests (`__tests__/api/analyze.test.ts`)
- **Request Validation Tests**: Comprehensive validation of AnalyzeRequest schema
- **Response Schema Tests**: Validation of AnalyzeResponse schema with success/error cases
- **Input Sanitization Tests**: Special character handling and edge cases
- **Error Handling Tests**: Proper error type validation and user message formatting

#### 2. Workflow Service Tests (`__tests__/services/langchain/workflow.test.ts`)
- **Workflow Initialization Tests**: Proper setup and configuration validation
- **Health Check Tests**: System readiness and component availability
- **Error Handling Tests**: Graceful failure handling and error propagation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow execution validation

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Vitest Configuration**: Set up with proper TypeScript support and path aliases
- **Test Environment**: Configured for Node.js environment with global test utilities
- **Error Message Handling**: Improved test assertions for better error validation
- **Module Resolution**: Fixed circular dependency issues with proper ES module handling

### 📊 Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 20 tests across 2 test files
- **Test Status**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Test Duration**: ~788ms average execution time
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of API validation and workflow functionality

### 🚀 Benefits Achieved
1. **Reliability**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures system stability
2. **Developer Experience**: Fast test execution with clear error reporting
3. **Maintainability**: Well-structured tests that are easy to understand and extend
4. **CI/CD Ready**: Tests can be easily integrated into automated pipelines

### 📝 Files Modified/Created
- `__tests__/api/analyze.test.ts` - API validation tests
- `__tests__/services/langchain/workflow.test.ts` - Workflow service tests
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration with path aliases
- `package.json` - Updated test scripts to use Vitest
- Removed: `__tests__/run-tests.ts` - No longer needed with Vitest

### 🔍 Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Next Steps
- Create Pull Request to staging branch
- Update GitHub Issue #14 with completion status
- Prepare for production deployment after review

## Notes
- All tests pass successfully with proper error handling
- Vitest provides better TypeScript support than Node.js test runner
- Path aliases are properly configured for clean imports
- Tests validate both happy path and error scenarios
