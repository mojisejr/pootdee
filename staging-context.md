- Configured proper CDN and perspective settings

**3. Query Utilities & Data Access**
- Created comprehensive GROQ query utilities in `queries.ts`
- Implemented type-safe query functions for all phrase operations
- Added filtering, pagination, and search capabilities
- Included parameter validation and error handling

**4. TypeScript Interface System**
- Defined complete type system in `interfaces/phrase.ts`
- Created interfaces for CRUD operations, analysis, and filtering
- Implemented type guards and utility types
- Ensured type safety across the entire system

**5. Service Layer Implementation**
- Built complete `PhraseService` class with CRUD operations
- Implemented batch operations and statistical queries
- Added comprehensive error handling and validation
- Created type-safe service methods with proper return types

**6. Sanity Studio UX Enhancement**
- Configured enhanced studio structure with organized navigation
- Added difficulty-based filtering and bookmarked phrase views
- Implemented recent phrases and review-needed sections
- Enhanced user experience with icons and logical grouping
