## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY RULES

### NEVER MERGE PRS YOURSELF

**DO NOT** use any commands to merge Pull Requests, such as `gh pr merge`. Your role is to create a well-documented PR and provide the link to the user.

**ONLY** provide the PR link to the user and **WAIT** for explicit user instruction to merge. The user will review and merge when ready.

### DO NOT DELETE CRITICAL FILES

You are **FORBIDDEN** from deleting or moving critical files and directories in the project. This includes, but is not limited to: `.env`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`, `package.json` and the main project root files. If a file or directory needs to be removed, you must explicitly ask for user permission and provide a clear explanation.

### HANDLE SENSITIVE DATA WITH CARE

You must **NEVER** include sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, or user data in any commit messages, Pull Request descriptions, or public logs. Always use environment variables for sensitive data. If you detect sensitive data, you must alert the user and **REFUSE** to proceed until the information is properly handled.

### STICK TO THE SCOPE

You are instructed to focus **ONLY** on the task described in the assigned Issue. Do not perform any refactoring, code cleanup, or new feature development unless it is explicitly part of the plan. If you encounter an opportunity to improve the code outside of the current scope, you must create a new task and discuss it with the user first.

### Start Simple (IMPORTANT !)

When implement new feature, and refactoring **starts simple with best practice approch** and then gradually move to complex if it's needed.

### CONFLICT PREVENTION & BRANCH SAFETY

**MANDATORY STAGING BRANCH SYNC**: Before any implementation (`=impl`), you **MUST** ensure the local staging branch is synchronized with remote origin. Use `git fetch origin && git checkout staging && git pull origin staging` to sync.

**STAGING-FIRST WORKFLOW**: All implementations work exclusively with staging branch. **NEVER** create PRs to main branch or interact with main branch during `=impl`. The user will handle main branch merges manually.

**FORCE PUSH RESTRICTIONS**: Only use `git push --force-with-lease` when absolutely necessary. **NEVER** use `git push --force` as it can overwrite team members' work. Always prefer clean rebasing and conflict resolution.

**EMERGENCY CONFLICT RESOLUTION**: If conflicts are detected during implementation:

1. **STOP** all operations immediately
2. **ALERT** the user about the conflict
3. **PROVIDE** clear resolution steps
4. **WAIT** for user approval before proceeding
5. **DOCUMENT** the resolution in commit messages

### AUTOMATED WORKFLOW SAFETY

**BRANCH NAMING ENFORCEMENT**: All feature branches **MUST** follow the pattern `feature/[issue-number]-[description]` (e.g., `feature/123-user-authentication`).

**COMMIT MESSAGE STANDARDS**: All commits **MUST** include:

- Clear, descriptive subject line (max 50 characters)
- Detailed body explaining the changes (if needed)
- Reference to related issue number
- Type prefix: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`

**PR CREATION REQUIREMENTS**: All Pull Requests **MUST** include:

- Comprehensive description of changes
- Link to related GitHub issue
- Testing instructions
- Breaking changes documentation (if any)
- Conflict resolution summary (if applicable)

---

## üöÄ Development Workflows

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Synchronize Time Before Any File Operations

Before creating a new file or saving any timestamps, you MUST use the following command to retrieve the current date and time from the system:

date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
This ensures accurate timestamp synchronization with the system clock and prevents time-related inconsistencies.

### Logging Strategy

**console.log will be 3 types **

- **INFO**: For general information messages that logged on both production and development environments eg. `INFO: User XYZ has successfully logged in.`
- **ERROR**: For error messages that logged on both production and development environments.
  eg. `ERROR: Failed to connect to database.`
- **DEBUG**: For debug messages that logged on development environments only.
  eg. `DEBUG: Database connection established.`

### The Two-Issue Pattern

This project uses a Two-Issue Pattern to separate work context from actionable plans, integrating local workflows with GitHub Issues for clarity and traceability.

- **Context Issues (`=fcs`):** Used to record the current state and context of a session on GitHub.

- **Task Issues (`=plan`):** Used to create a detailed and comprehensive plan of action on GitHub. The agent will use information from the latest Context Issue as a reference.

### Shortcut Commands

These commands are standard across all projects and streamline our communication with **AUTOMATED WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**.

### Shortcut Commands

... (‡∏™‡πà‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏≥‡∏™‡∏±‡πà‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏°‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì)

- **`=update-kb`**: **CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE UPDATE WORKFLOW** - Instructs the agent to update the project's **Shared Knowledge Base** file (`/docs/project_status.md` or `/docs/project_state.json`) with the latest architectural, UI, and functionality details. This command ensures persistent context and prevents a loss of project memory.
  1.  **Context Analysis**: Analyze the latest code changes, UI components, and system functionality.
  2.  **File Update**: Overwrite the existing knowledge base file with the new, comprehensive snapshot of the project's state.
  3.  **Synchronization**: Ensure the updated file is ready for all other agents and developers to read before any new implementation begins.
      **MANDATORY RULE**: This command **MUST** be executed after every successful implementation (`=impl`) to ensure the project's state is always synchronized.

- **`=fcs > [message]`**: Updates the `current-focus.md` file on the local machine and creates a **GitHub Context Issue** with the specified `[message]` as the title. **WARNING**: This command will only work if there are no open GitHub issues. If there are, the agent will alert you to clear the backlog before you can save a new context. To bypass this check, use the command `=fcs -f > [message]`.

- **`=plan > [question/problem]`**: Creates a **GitHub Task Issue** with a detailed and comprehensive plan of action. **STAGING-FIRST WORKFLOW & CONFLICT PREVENTION** - The agent will:
  1. **Pre-Planning Validation**:
     - **Auto-check**: Verify staging branch is up-to-date with remote
     - **Warning**: Alert if staging is behind remote origin
     - **Mandatory Sync**: Automatically sync staging before planning if needed
     - **PR Status Check**: Verify no conflicting open PRs exist
     - **Branch Status**: Check for existing feature branches and potential conflicts

  2. **Codebase Analysis Phase**: For non-new feature implementations (fixes, refactors, modifications):
     - Search and analyze all relevant code components and dependencies
     - Identify side effects and interconnected systems
     - Review existing patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
     - Map data flow and component relationships
     - Assess impact on related functionality
     - **File Coordination Check**: Identify high-risk files requiring team coordination

  3. **Plan Creation Phase**: Use all gathered information including:
     - Current focus context from `current-focus.md`
     - Previous conversation history
     - Comprehensive codebase analysis results
     - Identified dependencies and side effects
     - **Staging Context Creation**: Include `staging-context.md` creation in implementation plan

  If an open Task Issue already exists, the agent will **update** that Issue with the latest information instead of creating a new one.

- **`=impl > [message]`**: **STAGING-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW** - Instructs the agent to execute the plan contained in the latest **GitHub Task Issue** with full automation:
  1. **Pre-Implementation Validation**:
     - **MANDATORY**: Ensure currently on staging branch (`git checkout staging`)
     - **MANDATORY**: Sync staging with remote origin (`git pull origin staging`)
     - **MANDATORY**: Verify no existing open PRs that could conflict
     - **MANDATORY**: Ensure clean working directory before proceeding
     - **Conflict Detection**: Check for potential conflicts before starting
     - **Emergency Protocol**: Activate emergency resolution if conflicts detected

  2. **Auto-Branch Creation**: Creates feature branch from staging with proper naming (`feature/[issue-number]-[description]`)
  3. **Implementation**: Executes the planned work with continuous conflict monitoring
  4. **Enhanced Commit & Push Flow**:
     - **Pre-commit Validation**: Check for conflicts before each commit
     - **Descriptive Commits**: Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
     - **Safe Push Strategy**: Force push only when necessary with `--force-with-lease`
     - **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict detection and resolution protocols

  5. **Staging Context Creation**: Creates `staging-context.md` with implementation details
  6. **Auto-PR Creation**: Creates Pull Request **TO STAGING BRANCH ONLY** with proper description and issue references
  7. **Issue Updates**: Updates the plan issue with PR link and completion status
  8. **User Notification**: Provides PR link for review and approval - **USER HANDLES MAIN BRANCH MERGES MANUALLY**

- **`=stage > [message]`**: **STAGING DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW** - Deploys approved changes from feature branch to staging environment:
  1. **Pre-Staging Validation**:
     - **Feature Branch Validation**: Ensure feature branch is ready for staging
     - **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve any conflicts with staging branch
     - **Test Validation**: Run automated tests before staging deployment

### üìã Staging Context File Management

#### Auto-Cleanup Strategy for `staging-context.md`

**File Creation & Location**:

- **Created during**: `=impl` command execution
- **Location**: Project root directory (`./staging-context.md`)
- **Content**: Implementation details, deployment context, testing notes

**Lifecycle Management**:

- **Creation**: Automatically generated during feature implementation
- **Updates**: Modified during `=stage` deployment process
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removed during `=prod` deployment completion
- **Backup**: Context preserved in PR descriptions and commit messages

**File Management Benefits**:

- **Deployment Tracking**: Clear visibility of staging deployment status
- **Context Preservation**: Implementation details available during staging phase
- **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual file management required
- **Conflict Prevention**: Reduces repository clutter and merge conflicts

**Cleanup Triggers**:

- **Successful Production Deployment**: File automatically deleted after `=prod` completion
- **Failed Deployments**: File retained for debugging and rollback procedures
- **Manual Cleanup**: Available via `=prod --cleanup-only` command
- **Branch Cleanup**: Removed when feature branch is deleted

### üîÑ Plan Issue Management Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: For large, multi-phase projects, the agent must **UPDATE** existing plan issues instead of creating new ones.

- **When completing phases**: Update the plan issue to reflect completed phases and mark them as ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Progress tracking**: Update the issue description with current status, next steps, and any blockers
- **Phase completion**: When a phase is finished, update the plan issue immediately before moving to the next phase
- **Never create new issues**: For ongoing multi-phase work, always update the existing plan issue (#20 for current system refactor)
- **Retrospective issues**: Only create retrospective issues for session summaries, not for plan updates

### üéØ Enhanced Implementation Workflows

#### Branch Management Excellence

- **ALWAYS** create feature branches: `feature/[issue-number]-[description]`
- **NEVER** work directly on main branch
- **Workflow**: Analysis ‚Üí Branch ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí PR ‚Üí Updates

#### TodoWrite Integration Patterns

**High-Impact Usage**: Complex refactoring (3+ files), multi-phase implementations, large system changes
**Best Practices**: 5-8 specific todos, exactly ONE in_progress, complete immediately after finishing

### üåø Automated Workflow Implementation

‚úÖ Pattern replication following proven approaches
‚úÖ Large refactoring with dependency management

‚ùå Single file edits or trivial changes
‚ùå Simple documentation updates
‚ùå Quick bug fixes without multiple steps
```

##### Branch Naming Convention

- **Format**: `feature/[issue-number]-[sanitized-description]`
- **Source**: All feature branches **MUST** be created from `staging` branch
- **Flow**: `feature/[issue] ‚Üí staging ‚Üí main`
- **Example**: `feature/27-deployment-production-implementation`
- **Auto-sanitization**: Removes special characters, converts to kebab-case

##### Commit Message Standards

- **Format**: `[type]: [description] (#[issue-number])`
- **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
- **Example**: `feat: implement user authentication system (#25)`

##### Pull Request Automation

**Staging PRs** (Feature ‚Üí Staging):

- **Title**: `[STAGING] [Feature Title] (#[issue-number])`
- **Description**: Implementation details, testing notes, staging deployment context
- **Context File**: References `staging-context.md` for deployment details
- **Issue Linking**: `Relates to #[issue-number]` (keeps issue open for production)

**Production PRs** (Staging ‚Üí Main):

- **Title**: `[PRODUCTION] [Feature Title] (#[issue-number])`
- **Description**: Production deployment summary, staging validation results
- **Context File**: Includes staging validation and production readiness checklist
- **Issue Linking**: `Closes #[issue-number]` (closes issue after production deployment)

#### Workflow Safety Measures

**Enhanced Branch Protection**:

- **Main Branch**: Requires 2+ approvals, status checks, up-to-date branches
- **Staging Branch**: Requires 1+ approval, automated testing, conflict resolution
- **Feature Branches**: Standard protection, automated conflict detection

**Staging Sync Protocol**:

- **Pre-Implementation**: Always sync staging with main before creating feature branches
- **Pre-Staging**: Ensure feature branch is up-to-date with staging before PR
- **Pre-Production**: Validate staging branch is ready for main merge

**Conflict Prevention**:

- **Staging-First Rule**: All features go through staging before production
- **Sync Validation**: Automated checks for branch synchronization
- **Emergency Protocol**: Immediate conflict resolution for critical deployments

**CRITICAL RULES**:

- **NEVER** work directly on main/staging branches
- **ALWAYS** create feature branches from staging
- **ALWAYS** deploy to staging before production
- **ALWAYS** validate staging deployment before main PR

### Implementation Guidelines for Automated Workflow

#### Pre-Implementation Checks

- ‚úÖ Verify GitHub Task Issue exists and is properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Ensure no conflicting branches exist
- ‚úÖ Confirm GitHub CLI is authenticated and functional
- ‚úÖ Validate repository permissions for branch creation and PR management

#### Error Handling and Fallbacks

- **Branch Creation Failure**: Falls back to manual branch creation with user guidance
- **Push Failure**: Provides manual push commands and troubleshooting steps
- **PR Creation Failure**: Falls back to manual PR creation with pre-filled templates
- **Issue Update Failure**: Logs error and provides manual update instructions

#### Quality Assurance

**Staging PR Requirements**:

- **Reviewers**: Minimum 1 reviewer approval required
- **Automated Checks**: Build validation, type checking, linting
- **Context File**: Must reference `staging-context.md` with deployment details
- **Testing**: Feature testing in staging environment

#### Monitoring and Feedback
